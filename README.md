# University of Ruhuna Job Bank

Welcome to the University of Ruhuna Job Bank project! This software project aims to create a job bank website that connects three primary user roles: companies, students, and lecturers. Companies will be able to post job opportunities, students can apply for those jobs, and lecturers can provide recommendations for students.

## Features

1. **Company Portal**: Companies can create accounts and post job opportunities to the University of Ruhuna Job Bank. They can provide detailed job descriptions, required qualifications, application deadlines, and other relevant information.

2. **Student Portal**: Students can create accounts, browse through available job opportunities, and apply for the ones that match their interests and qualifications. They can upload their resumes, cover letters, and other supporting documents.

3. **Lecturer Portal**: Lecturers can access the system to review and provide recommendations for students who have applied for jobs. They can evaluate students based on their academic performance, skills, and other relevant criteria.

4. **Search and Filtering**: The website will provide search and filtering functionalities to enable students to find jobs that align with their preferences. They can search by job title, industry, location, or any other relevant criteria.

5. **Notifications and Reminders**: The system will send notifications and reminders to keep users informed about important updates, such as application deadlines, interview invitations, and recommendation requests.

6. **User Profiles**: Each user will have a profile where they can manage their personal information, update their resumes, view their application history, and track the status of their applications.

7. **Admin Dashboard**: An admin dashboard will be available to manage the system, including user accounts, job postings, and overall system settings.

## Technologies Used

The University of Ruhuna Job Bank website will be built using the following technologies:

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern front-end framework like React or Angular.
- **Back-end**: A server-side programming language such as Python, Ruby, or Node.js, along with a web framework like Django, Ruby on Rails, or Express.js.
- **Database**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgresSQL, or SQLite to store user information, job details, and recommendations.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: A secure authentication and authorization mechanism, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to manage user login and access control.
- **Version Control**: Git will be used for version control and collaboration among the development team.
- **Deployment**: The website can be deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or on a shared hosting provider.
